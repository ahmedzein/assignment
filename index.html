        <p class="dropcap">During its nine-year network run, Seinfeld, which premiered in 1990 on NBC, set the meandering course for four single friends living in New York. The group's core is Jerry (Jerry Seinfeld), a stand up comedian whose professional path includes a shot of creating a network sitcom, a guest spot on the "Today" show, and a wealth of other quests gone-awry with a personal life rife with an endless parade of never-quite-right girlfriends. His childhood best friend, George Costanza (Jason Alexander), could be deemed the quintessential loser; he can never hold a job or keep a romance.. although he has more than enough schemes to make either happen. Jerry's ex, Elaine Benes (Julia Loius-Dreyfus) offers the quirky quartet her own barrage of bad dates and worrisome workplace sagas. The curiously-coiffed Kramer (Michael Richards) rounds up the group as Jerry's over-the-top imaginative and often-mysterious neighbor, who has no visible means of support and an uncanny knack for opening doors to opportunities he has no business being near.</p>

        <p>Currently, Seinfeld airs in high-profile time periods in leading television stations in more than 200 markets around the U.S., representing more than 99 percent of the viewing audience. Seinfeld's national demographic rating in syndication, particularly among males and young adults, have outrated the best of current broadcast network and cable programs.</p>

        <p>In fact, the show's popularity seems to have an endless reign. <em>The Parking Garage</em> and <em>The Boyfriend</em> were named by <strong>TV Guide</strong> as two of the greatest episodes in television history, and others including <em>The Pez Dispenser</em> and <em>The Contest</em>, earned spots as two of the funniest moments in TV history. The characters also keep on resonating with audiences: George Costanza and Kramer were named by TV Guide as two of TV's greatest characters. In 2001, a TV Guide cover story detailed that “It's been three years since Seinfeld went off the air (in primetime), and yet the show -in reruns- is still the best comedy on TV.”</p>
